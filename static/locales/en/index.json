I’m now thinking of porting it to Astro, which is a much better choice for simple landing pages like this (but didn’t exist in 2020). Why? Astro ships zero JavaScript by default and has great lazy loading capabilities out of the box (and is therefore fast). It’s what I’ve used for the Dash landing page also."

That I also practice meditation and eat vegan probably classifies me as a health nut, but I am a sucker for craft beer ;) (D/T(NE)IPA's!). In my spare time I like to work on one of my side projects. Dash is one of them; a Figma plugin that helps designers speed up their workflow with search and a simple command UI. I really enjoy making tools that make live just a little bit easier."
